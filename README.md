# Social Network Backend

## Description
This project is a lightweight database for a social network utilizing the NoSQL technologies of MongoDB and Mongoose. It allows you to create profiles, add friends, create posts, and comment on those posts.

This project was quite difficult, given that I find NoSQL significantly more confusing than SQL, due to the lack of structure and associations. However, I think I now grasp the use and application of this technology much better.

## Usage
A video showing the usage of the website, utilizing Insomnia, can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gQoC0IzlOdykgfzsWO-TlM-Ogttf-Xd6/view?usp=drive_link).

## Installation
Clone the repository to your home machine, and then run the `npm i` command. Open a terminal and run the command `mongod`. Then finally you can use the command `node index.js` in the root folder of this repository to run the program, then query it via whichever means you please.

## Credits
All code was created by me, with the assistance of the Mongoose and MongoDB documentation.
